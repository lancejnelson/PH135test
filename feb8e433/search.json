    "text": "Python is a computer programming language available on all major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux). Python is a scripting language which means that the computer interprets and runs your code at the moment you run it. In contrast, in a compiled language like C the code must first be converted into binary before it can run (called “compiling” the code). There are pros and cons to both types of languages. The on-the-fly interpretation of Python makes it quick and easy to write code and provides fast results for simple calculations. When codes become longer and more complex, on-the-fly interpretation becomes less efficient and execution time will be much slower than it would be with a compiled language. The pros and cons flip for a comiled language; writing code in a compiled language can be cumbersome and slow, but the execution time is typically much faster. Out of necessity, most programmers become proficient in both types of languages. Python(or another interpreted language) is used to “toy around” with your problem and build familiarity. As the complexity of the code increases the user is then forced to transition to a compiled language to get the needed speed. This is the famous “two language” problem and there is a new programming language designed to eliminate this problem by combining the pros from both into one language. (The name of the language is Julia)\nPython is free, open source software and is maintained by the non-profit Python software foundation. This is great because it means that you will always have free access to the Python language regardless of what organization or univeristy you are affliated with. You’ll never have to worry about not being able to use your Python code without paying for it. Another benefit of open source languages is that all of the codes developed by other people are available for anyone to inspect and modify. This allows anyone to review another’s code to ensure that it does what they say it does, or to modify it to do something else. One last benefit that comes with an open source language is the community of Python users available to answer questions and provide instruction to the beginner. Answers to most questions about python are readily available on tutorial or forum websites.\n\n\n\nThe first step is to install the software (if you haven’t already). The most convenient way to install Python and also get many of the commonly-used libraries is to use an installer. I recommend Anaconda. When installing the software be sure to choose Python 3 since this is the current version. By default, Anaconda will install a suit of sotwares and libraries that are commonly used. If you want to install other Python libraries, open the Anaconda-Navigator (green circle icon) and select the Environment tab on the left. Select Not Installed from the pull-down to see all of the libraries that are available to be installed. To install a library, check the box next to it and click Apply. Anaconda will take care of the rest.\n\nTo Do:\n\nInstall Anaconda\nCheck to see if the library “numpy” is installed. If not, install it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Jupyter notebook is an electronic document designed to support interactive data processing, analysis, and visualization in an easily shared format. A Jupyter notebook can contain live code, math equations, explanatory text, and the output of codes (numbers, plots, graphics, etc..). To launch a Jupyter notebook, first open Anaconda-Navigator (green circle icon) and click the Launch button under JupyterLab. Jupyter can also be launched from the command line by typing jupyter-lab. The jupyter notebook will launch in your default web browser, but it is not a website. From here you can select an already existing Jupyter notebook, denoted by the orange icons and the .ipynb extension, or create a new notebook by clicking New from the File menu.\n\nTo Do:\n\nOn iLearn, find the module entitled “Jupyter Notebooks” and download the file “Intro.ipynb”.\nLaunch JupyterLab as explained above.\nOpen “Intro.ipynb” that you downloaded in step 1 and continue reading this book in the jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of “cells” in a Jupyter notebook: code cells and text cells (also called Markdown cell). Code cells contain “live” Python code that can be run inside of the notebook with any output appearing directly below it. Markdown cells are designed to contain explanatory information about what is happening inside of the code cells. They can contain text, math equations, and images. Markdown cells suport markdown, html, and Latex (for generating pretty math equations).\nBoth markdown and code cells can be executed by either selecting Run Selected Cells in the Run menu, by clicking the Play icon at the top of the notebook, or by using the Shift-Return shortcut when your curson is in the desired cell.\n\n\n\nNavigating a Jupyter notebook is fairly straightforward but there are a few handy shortcuts/hotkeys that will make navigation quicker and your workflow more efficient. When working in a Jupyter notebook, you are always operating in one of two modes: edit mode or navigate mode. In edit mode you can make modifications to the text or code in a cell and in navigate mode you can add/delete cells and modify the cell type. If you can see a blinking cursor in one of the cells you are in edit mode. Otherwise you are in navigate mode. To exit edit mode, simply press the esc key and you will enter navigate mode. To exit navigate mode, simply press the enter key and you will enter edit mode for the cell you were focused on. (You can also double click on a cell with your mouse to enter edit mode.) The shift + enter key sequence will “execute” a cell and produce the associated output. For text cells, executing just means to render the text in a nicely formatted fashion. “Executing” a code cell will actually execute the code block contained in the cell. You also enter navigate mode every time you execute a cell using the shift + enter key sequence. A summary of these shortcuts is given below:\n\nUp/down arrows - Navigate to different cells in the notebook.\nY - turns a text cell into a code cell.\nM - turns a code cell into a text cell.\nA - inserts a new cell above the current cell.\nB - inserts a new cell below the current cell.\nX - deletes the current cell.\nenter - enters edit mode.\nshift + enter - execute a cell.\nesc - enter navigate mode.\n\nYou should take some time now to practice these shortcut keys until you become good at navigating a jupyter notebook. Consider attempting the following actions using the shortcuts above:\n\nAdd a cell below this one.\nTurn the cell into a code cell (observe the distinct appearance of code cells).\nType the following code into the cell:\n\nprint(\"I did it!\")\n\nExecute the cell using shift + enter. Observe the output.\nDelete the cell.\nEnter edit mode for this text cell.\nAdd a sentence of your choice at the end of the cell.\n“Execute” the cell and observe the new output.\nRemove the sentence to restore the cell to it’s previous state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks in this class will be a nice mix of text cells (explanation) and code cells (examples). You will soon learn that code cells produce no output unless you explicitly tell them to using a print statement (similar to the one you used above). When you encounter a code cell, you should feel free to make modifications and additions to the cell until you fully understand how the code works.\n\n\n\nComments are a way to describe what each section of code does and makes it easier for you and others to understand the code. It may seem clear what each section of code does as you write it, but after a week, month or longer, it is unlikely to be obvious. Paul Wilson of the University of Wisconson at Madison is quoted as saying, “Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don’t reply to emails.” Comment your code now so that you are not confused later.\nThere are several ways to add comments to your code:\n\nUse # to start a comment. Everything on that line the follows will be ignored.\nFor longer comments that will span several lines, use triple double quotes to begin and end the comment (\"\"\")\n\nThe cell below illustrates these two ways to make comments:\n# Speed of light in a vacuum\nc = 3e8\n\nv = 300 # Speed of sound in air\n\n\"\"\"\nThe variables below are the initial conditions for a cannon\nlaunching a ball at a 30 degree angle with an initial speed of\n50 m/s.  The initial height of the cannon ball is 1000 m\n\"\"\"\nv = 50\ntheta = 30\nh_i = 1000\n\nTo Do:\n\nExecute the code block below and verify that no output is produced.\nAdd print statements that help you see the result of the calculation.\nAdd simple commments next to each line explaining the code.\n\n\na = 2 \nb = 3 \nc = a**b\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef install(package):\n    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", package])\ninstall(\"numpy\")"
